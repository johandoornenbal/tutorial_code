In this step we are going to refine the UI.
As mentioned before there are two ways of controlling the UI

* the use of annotations
* overruled by the use of `layout.json` files for more control

When we look at

it is clear that the column `Pet Owner` is superfluous.

We hide it by annotating `getPetOwner` with `@PropertyLayout(hidden = Where.REFERENCES_PARENT)`

----
@MemberOrder(sequence = "3")
@Column(name = "ownerId", allowsNull = "true")
@PropertyLayout(hidden = Where.REFERENCES_PARENT)
public PetOwner getPetOwner() {
    return petOwner;
}
